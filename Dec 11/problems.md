1. From an unsorted array of numbers 1 to 100 excluding one number, how
   would you find the missing number?
2. From an unsorted array, check whether there are any two numbers that
   will sum up to any given number (example: ([1,5,7,8,4,3,9] ,6) returns
   true & ([1,5,7,8,4,3,9] , 3) returns false)
3. Return the lowest index at which a value should be inserted into an array
   once it has been sorted. (example: ([1,2,3,5], 1.5) should return 1
   because it's greater than 1 (index 0) and less than 2 (index 1).
4. Write an algorithm that returns the reverse of a given word. For example, boat returns taob.
